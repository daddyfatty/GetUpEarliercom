I assembled this upper body pushups & biceps workout based on some of my favorite moves from Shawn T‚Äôs Insanity and Tony Horton‚Äôs p90x with a biceps intermission inspired by a workout from Sagi Kalev in old ‚ÄúBody Beast‚Äù - which I do 1-2x per month and on vacationsüî•

Perfect for a home gym, working from home, office, or hotel/travel. 

In this workout I introduce Iron Master ‚Ä™@IronmasterPro‚Ä¨  adjustable dumbbells as a great addition to my home gym.

Just under 20 minutes, 12 total sets of floor work for chest, triceps, shoulders, and back, and 12 total sets of seated dumbbell hammer curls.
