This granola is my go-to carb-loading snack for marathon training. I created it out of frustration with low-quality store-bought options full of added sugar, seed oils, and high prices. I wanted a cleaner, more natural option with high-quality carbs, healthy fats, and balanced sweetness to fuel my long runs without compromising nutrition.

I modeled it after brands like Purely Elizabeth and Grandy Organics but replaced the processed ingredients with raw honey and pure maple syrup as sweeteners and binders, and grass-fed butter for better fats and flavor.

Raw honey is perfect for endurance, offering quick, digestible carbs with a low glycemic index for steady energy. It also provides antioxidants and essential minerals like potassium and magnesium to support muscle function and recovery.

This granola’s mix of slow- and fast-digesting carbs, healthy fats, and protein makes it ideal for carb-loading and supporting energy levels during long runs.
