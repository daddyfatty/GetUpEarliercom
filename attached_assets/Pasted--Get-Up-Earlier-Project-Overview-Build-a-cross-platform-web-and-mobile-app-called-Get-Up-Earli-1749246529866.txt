"Get Up Earlier"
Project Overview:
Build a cross-platform (web and mobile) app called Get Up Earlier for Personal Training, Nutrition, and Accountability Coaching. The app should help users bridge the gap from inactivity and poor diet to strength and healthy habits, and also serve as a platform for selling a continuously updated recipe book (digital and hardcopy). The app should support a subscription model and integrate with Shopify or Webflow for e-commerce functionality.
