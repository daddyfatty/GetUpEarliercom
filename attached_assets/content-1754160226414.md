In this video, I demonstrate a necessary hard drop test using 100lb [#ironmaster](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/ironmaster) Adjustable Dumbbells. Sometimes, you just have to drop weights. The setup includes the base 75lb IronMaster Adjustable Dumbbells, a 15lb Heavy Handles add-on, long screws, and additional weights purchased locally to achieve a total weight of 100lbs. I have been HAMMERING these dumbbells for over a year.

Check out my real-life experience with IronMaster Adjustable Dumbbells, where I hit a personal record that I'm really proud of. In this video, I'm showing how these dumbbells have been a game-changer for me, allowing me to gradually increase my lifting game until I was able to lift and then drop (out of necessity) 100-pound weights without ANY damage. Achieving this at 49 proves that it's never too late to smash your goals with the right equipment.

Back in my 20s, I was all about heavy lifting, but life got in the way, and it wasn't until my 40s, especially during the COVID lockdown, that I got back into strength training seriously. The IronMaster dumbbells were a key part of this comeback. They let me work up through the weights in my own time, in my own space, without needing a garage full of different weights. Whether I'm pushing past 80 pounds or targeting the 110s, these dumbbells have shown they're tough, versatile, and perfe…...more
