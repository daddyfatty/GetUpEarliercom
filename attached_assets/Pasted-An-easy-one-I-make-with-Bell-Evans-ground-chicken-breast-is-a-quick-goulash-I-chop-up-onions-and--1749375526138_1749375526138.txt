An easy one I make with Bell & Evans ground chicken breast is a quick goulash! I chop up onions and a fresh green pepper (but you can use any color) and sauté them for a bit with salt, pepper, and granulated California garlic (Kirkland). Then, I throw in the pound of ground chicken breast and break it up into the peppers and onions while seasoning to taste with basil, oregano, and a little parsley. Once the chicken is white and cooked, I throw in a can of crushed tomatoes (see pic—these are my favorite tomatoes at Whole Foods). Once bubbling, bring it down to simmer for a few minutes, add some Parmesan and more salt and pepper. Then, we usually have this over white rice (frozen pouches from Trader Joe’s).

Ingredients
1 pound Bell & Evans ground chicken breast
1/2 medium onion, chopped
1 fresh green bell pepper (or any color), chopped
1 can (about 14 oz) crushed tomatoes (preferred brand: San Merican Tomatoes at Whole Foods)
1 tablespoon olive oil (optional)
1/2 teaspoon salt (to taste)
1/4 teaspoon black pepper (to taste)
1/2 teaspoon granulated California garlic (Kirkland recommended)
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon dried parsley
Few shakes grated Parmesan cheese
2 cups cooked white rice (Trader Joe's frozen pouches suggested)
Instructions
Prepare Vegetables: Chop the onion and bell pepper into small, even pieces.
Sauté Vegetables: In a large skillet, heat olive oil (if using) over medium heat. Add the onion and bell pepper. Sauté until softened, about 5 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and granulated garlic.
Cook Chicken: Add the ground chicken breast to the skillet. Break it up into small pieces as it cooks. Season with basil, oregano, parsley, and additional salt and pepper to taste. Cook until the chicken is white and fully cooked, about 7-10 minutes.
Add Tomatoes: Pour in the can of crushed tomatoes. Stir well to combine. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil, then reduce heat to a simmer. Allow to simmer for 5-10 minutes to let the flavors meld.
Finish with Parmesan: Stir in grated Parmesan cheese. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.
Serve: Spoon the goulash over cooked white rice. Serve hot and enjoy!
Notes
This dish is versatile; try swapping out green peppers for red, yellow, or orange for a sweeter flavor.
Adjust seasoning to taste, adding chili flakes for a bit of spice if desired.
