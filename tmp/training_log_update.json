It's highlighted in the image below.\\n\\nIt's all the way at the end of Orange Center right before Racebrook. KILLS but running hills consistently in the heat will make you strong and tired as hell.\\n\\nTime on foot means how long you're out there moving. It's not about speed, it's about duration. The longer you stay on your feet, the more your body adapts to the demands of distance. That's where endurance is built. It teaches your body to handle fatigue, get used to what race day will feel like, and burn fat more efficiently. When you're running at an easy pace for a long time, your body taps into fat for fuel instead of just burning glycogen.
